# කේතක (Kethaka)

Welcome to කේතක (Kethaka), a Sinhala compile-time coding language! This project allows you to write code in Sinhala and compile it to Python bytecode for execution.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the කේතක project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/IroshPerera03/Kethaka.git
    cd kethaka
    ```

2. **Ensure Python is installed**:

    ```sh
    python3 --version
    ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Make the scripts executable**:
    ```sh
    chmod +x kethaka kethakac
    ```

## Available Commands

### Compile a Sinhala source file to bytecode

```sh
./kethakac <source_file.snl>
```

### Run the compiled bytecode

```sh
./kethaka <bytecode_file.kbc>
```

## Example

Here is a simple example of a Sinhala source file (`example.snl`):

```sinhala
සඳහන් x = 10;
මුද්‍රණය(x);
```

To compile and run this example:

1. Compile the source file to bytecode:
    ```sh
    ./kethakac example.snl
    ```

2. Run the compiled bytecode:
    ```sh
    ./kethaka example.kbc
    ```
